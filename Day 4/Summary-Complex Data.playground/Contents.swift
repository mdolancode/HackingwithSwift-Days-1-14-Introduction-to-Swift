/* Summary: Comple Data
 * Arrays store many value, and read them using indices - must be all the same value type. Count, append, contains, and more
 * Dictionaries store many values, and read them using key words we specify. ie strings used as keys. One spcific type for key and for the value. Contains, count and more.
 * Sets stores many values, but we don't chose their order and it caanot have duplicates. Fast to get data.
 * Enums create our own types to specify a range of acceptable values. ie list of actions, type notifications and more. Specific values.
 * Swift uses type inference to figure out what data we're storing.
 * It's also possible to use type annotation to force a particular type.
 * Arrray will be used by far the most out of all these data type. So common.
 * Next Dictionaries
 * Last Sets - Even though last they are very useful and you will know when you need them.
