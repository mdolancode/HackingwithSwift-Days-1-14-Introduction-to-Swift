/*
 Summary Conditions and loops
 
 * We use if, else, and else if statements to check conditions.
 * You can combine conditions using || &&.
 * switch statements can be easier than using if and else if a lot, and Swift will check that they are exhaustive.
 * The ternary condition operator lets us check WTF: What?, True, False.
 * for loops let us loop over arrays, sets, dictionaries, and ranges, etc.
 * while loops create loops that continue running until a condition is false.
 * We can skip loop items using continue or break respectively.
