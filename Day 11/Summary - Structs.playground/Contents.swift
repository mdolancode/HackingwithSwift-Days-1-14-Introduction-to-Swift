// Summary: Structs
// * You can create your own structs using the struct keyword.
// * Structs can have their own properties and methods.
// * If a method modifies properties of its struct, it must be mutating.
// * Structs can have stored properties and computed properties.
// * We can attach didSet and willSet property observers to properties.
// * Swift generates an initializer for qll structs using their property names.
// * You can create custom initializers to override Swift's default.
// * Access control limits what code can use properties and methods.
// * Static properties and methods are attached directly to a struct.
