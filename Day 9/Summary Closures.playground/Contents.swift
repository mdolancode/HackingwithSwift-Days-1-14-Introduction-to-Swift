// Summary Closures
/*
 * You can copy functions in Swift.
 * You can create closures directly by assigning to a constant or variable.
 * Closure parameters and return value are declared inside their braces.
 * Functions are able to accept other functions as parameters.
 * Anywhere you can pass a function, you can also pass a closure.
 * When passing a closure as a function parameter, you don't need to write out the types inside your closure if Swift can figure it out.
 * If a function's final parameters are functions, use trailing closure syntax.
 * You can also use shorthand parameter names such as $0 and $1.
 * You can make your own functions that accepts functions as parameters.
